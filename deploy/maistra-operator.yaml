                              are chosen based on the first topology key with available

                              IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a
                              set of endpoints rather than a stable IP. "NodePort"
                              builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node

                              a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to
                              endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector
                              or if that is not specified, by manual construction
                              of an Endpoints object. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual
                              IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a
                              set of endpoints rather than a stable IP. "NodePort"
                              builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node
                              which routes to the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds
                              on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if
                              supported in the current cloud) which routes to the

                                          can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage
                                          of desired pods (ex: 10%). Absolute number
                                          is calculated from percentage by rounding
                                          down. This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0.
                                          Defaults to 25%. Example: when this is set
                                          to 30%, the old ReplicaSet can be scaled
                                          down to 70% of desired pods immediately
                                          when the rolling update starts. Once new
                                          pods are ready, old ReplicaSet can be scaled
                                          down further, followed by scaling up the
                                          new ReplicaSet, ensuring that the total
                                          number of pods available at all times during
                                          the update is at least 70% of desired pods.'
