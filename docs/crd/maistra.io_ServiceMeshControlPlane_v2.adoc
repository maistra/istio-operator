`ServiceMeshControlPlane` is the schema for the control plane API

.Table ServiceMeshControlPlane Fields
|===
| Name | Description | Type

| apiVersion
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
| string

| kind
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
| string

| metadata
| 
| <<metav1_ObjectMeta>>

| spec
| The specification of the desired state of this ServiceMeshControlPlane. This includes the configuration options for all components that comprise the control plane.
| <<ControlPlaneSpec>>

| status
| The current status of this ServiceMeshControlPlane and the components that comprise the control plane. This data may be out of date by some window of time.
| <<ControlPlaneStatus>>

ControlPlaneSpec represents the configuration for installing a control plane

.Table ControlPlaneSpec Fields
|===
| Name | Description | Type

| addons
| Addons is used to configure additional features beyond core control plane components, e.g. visualization, metric storage, etc.
| link:maistra.io_ServiceMeshControlPlane_AddonsConfig_v2.adoc[AddonsConfig]

| cluster
| Cluster is the general configuration of the cluster (cluster name, network name, multi-cluster, mesh expansion, etc.)
| link:maistra.io_ServiceMeshControlPlane_ControlPlaneClusterConfig_v2.adoc[ControlPlaneClusterConfig]

| gateways
| Gateways configures gateways for the mesh .Values.gateways.*
| link:maistra.io_ServiceMeshControlPlane_GatewaysConfig_v2.adoc[GatewaysConfig]

| general
| General represents general control plane configuration that does not logically fit in another area.
| link:maistra.io_ServiceMeshControlPlane_GeneralConfig_v2.adoc[GeneralConfig]

| policy
| Policy configures policy checking for the control plane. .Values.policy.enabled, true if not null
| link:maistra.io_ServiceMeshControlPlane_PolicyConfig_v2.adoc[PolicyConfig]

| profiles
| Profiles selects the profile to use for default values. Defaults to "default" when not set.
| []string

| proxy
| Proxy configures the default behavior for sidecars.  Many values were previously exposed through .Values.global.proxy
| link:maistra.io_ServiceMeshControlPlane_ProxyConfig_v2.adoc[ProxyConfig]

| runtime
| Runtime configuration for pilot (and galley, etc., pre 2.0)
| link:maistra.io_ServiceMeshControlPlane_ControlPlaneRuntimeConfig_v2.adoc[ControlPlaneRuntimeConfig]

| security
| Security configures aspects of security for the control plane.
| link:maistra.io_ServiceMeshControlPlane_SecurityConfig_v2.adoc[SecurityConfig]

| techPreview
| TechPreview contains switches for features that are not GA yet.
| link:maistra.io_ServiceMeshControlPlane_HelmValues_v1.adoc[HelmValues]

| telemetry
| Telemetry configures telemetry for the mesh. .Values.mixer.telemetry.enabled, true if not null.  1.6, .Values.telemetry.enabled
| link:maistra.io_ServiceMeshControlPlane_TelemetryConfig_v2.adoc[TelemetryConfig]

| tracing
| Tracing configures tracing for the mesh.
| link:maistra.io_ServiceMeshControlPlane_TracingConfig_v2.adoc[TracingConfig]

| version
| Version specifies what Maistra version of the control plane to install. When creating a new ServiceMeshControlPlane with an empty version, the admission webhook sets the version to the current version. Existing ServiceMeshControlPlanes with an empty version are treated as having the version set to "v1.0"

[#ControlPlaneStatus]
== ControlPlaneStatus

ControlPlaneStatus defines the observed state of ServiceMeshControlPlane ControlPlaneStatus represents the current state of a ServiceMeshControlPlane.

.Table ControlPlaneStatus Fields
|===
| Name | Description | Type

| annotations
| Annotations is an unstructured key value map used to store additional, usually redundant status information, such as the number of components deployed by the ServiceMeshControlPlane (number is redundant because you could just as easily count the elements in the ComponentStatus array). The reason to add this redundant information is to make it available to kubectl, which does not yet allow counting objects in JSONPath expressions.
| map[string]string

| conditions
| Represents the latest available observations of the object's current state.
| []Condition

| components
| 
| []ComponentStatus

| appliedSpec
| The resulting specification of the configuration options after all profiles have been applied.
| link:maistra.io_ServiceMeshControlPlane_v2.adoc#ControlPlaneSpec[ControlPlaneSpec]

| appliedValues
| The resulting values.yaml used to generate the charts.
| link:maistra.io_ServiceMeshControlPlane_v1.adoc#ControlPlaneSpec[ControlPlaneSpec]

| chartVersion
| The version of the charts that were last processed for this resource.
| string

| observedGeneration
| The generation observed by the controller during the most recent reconciliation. The information in the status pertains to this particular generation of the object.
| integer

| operatorVersion
| The version of the operator that last processed this resource.
| string

| readiness
| The readiness status of components & owned resources
| link:maistra.io_ServiceMeshControlPlane_ReadinessStatus_v2.adoc[ReadinessStatus]
